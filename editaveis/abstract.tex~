  \begin{otherlanguage*}{english}  

  This course conclusion work presents the results of a study to enable the
  deployment of a collaborative network for the University of
  Brasilia (UNB), which acts as a virtual environment for the creation and
  sharing of knowledge in a collaborative and horizontal way.
  %
  For this, we choose to use a Brazilian free social networks platform
  Noosfero, understanding that it satisfies the immediate needs of this
  proposal, according to studies from University of SÃ£o Paulo, when it
  adopted the same.
  %  
  Besides the implementation itself at UNB, this study includes a requirements
  elicitation and the implementation of a set of features and enhancements to
  the proposed platform, so that it would meet the basic needs for us to perform
  case studies with students from UnB Gama.
  %
  Also, we pointed out steps that will enable the continuity and the
  officialisation of the Comunidade.UnB network and it's constant evolution.
  %
  Additionally, our efforts and knowledge acquired in this work were transferred
  to a team of developers at UNB Gama, which will provide continuity to the
  deployment and implementation of this network in UNB, in 2014.
