This degree monograph presents a study about software usability and how to automate testing on the empirical software development to verify how automated testing may be related to software usability. For this, we conducted a study about applicability of BDD (Behaviour Driver Development) and usability techniques in software projects, as well as understand how to insert some studied techniques. In this study, we have tested some hypotheses to investigate the relationship between about automated testing approaches and software usability techniques.
